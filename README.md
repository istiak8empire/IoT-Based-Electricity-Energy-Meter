# IoT-Based-Electricity-Energy-Meter

This project aims to create an IoT-based smart electricity meter using an ESP32 microcontroller, the EmonLib library, and the Blynk platform.  The goal is to provide users with real-time and remote access to their electricity consumption data (voltage, current, power, and kWh) via a mobile app or web interface.  This allows for better energy management, cost savings through informed usage, and the potential for integration with smart home systems.  The project will also include data storage, analysis, and alerts for excessive consumption.  Ultimately, it seeks to promote energy efficiency and sustainability.
