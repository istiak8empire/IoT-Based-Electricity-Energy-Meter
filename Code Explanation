CODE EXPLANATION

A.	Libraries:
-	WiFi: Allows the ESP32 to connect to a Wi-Fi network.
-	WiFiClient: Enables the ESP32 to create a Wi-Fi client and communicate with other devices over the network.
-	BlynkSimpleEsp32: Provides the Blynk library for the ESP32, allowing communication with the Blynk server.
-	LiquidCrystal_I2C: Enables control of the 20x4 LCD display using the I2C protocol.
-	EmonLib: Library for energy monitoring, which provides functions to measure voltage and current.
-	EEPROM: Allows storing and retrieving data in the ESP32's EEPROM memory.

B.	Blynk-related definitions and authentication:
-	BLYNK_TEMPLATE_ID: The template ID associated with the Blynk project.
-	BLYNK_TEMPLATE_NAME: The name of the Blynk project.
-	BLYNK_AUTH_TOKEN: The authentication token for connecting the ESP32 to the Blynk server.

C.	Wi-Fi credentials:
-	ssid: The name of the Wi-Fi network to connect to.
-	pass: The password for the Wi-Fi network.

D.	LCD display initialization:
-	A LiquidCrystal_I2C object is created with the I2C address (0x27) and the dimensions of the LCD (20x4).

E.	Energy monitoring object and calibration values:
-	An EnergyMonitor object named "emon" is created.
-	voltageCalibration: Calibration value for voltage measurement.
-	currentCalibration: Calibration value for current measurement.

F.	Variables for energy tracking:
-	kWh: Accumulated energy consumption in kilowatt-hours.
-	totalCost: Total cost of energy consumption in Taka.
-	lastMillis: Stores the previous millis() value for time calculations.
-	costPerUnit: Cost per kilowatt-hour in Taka.

G.	Blynk virtual pin assignments:
-	VRMS_VIRTUAL_PIN: Virtual pin for displaying voltage RMS.
-	IRMS_VIRTUAL_PIN: Virtual pin for displaying current RMS.
-	POWER_VIRTUAL_PIN: Virtual pin for displaying power.
-	KWH_VIRTUAL_PIN: Virtual pin for displaying energy consumption in kilowatt-hours.
-	COST_VIRTUAL_PIN: Virtual pin for displaying the total cost.

H.	Blynk timer event:
-	The function myTimerEvent() is executed at a specified interval using the BlynkTimer object.
-	Inside the function, the voltage, current, power, energy consumption, and total cost are calculated.
-	The values are printed to the Serial Monitor.
-	The values are stored in the EEPROM memory.
-	The LCD display is updated with the new values.
-	The values are sent to the Blynk server using the Blynk.virtualWrite() function.

I.	Setup function:
-	The Serial communication is initiated.
-	Blynk connection is established using the Blynk.begin() function with the provided authentication token, Wi-Fi credentials, and Blynk server.
-	The LCD display is initialized and the backlight is turned on.
-	Energy monitoring is initialized with voltage and current calibration values.
-	The Blynk timer interval is set for data logging and display updates.
-	A startup message is displayed on the LCD.
-	A delay of 3 seconds is added, and the LCD is cleared.

J.	Loop function:
-	Blynk.run() and timer.run() are called to handle Blynk communication and timer events.
