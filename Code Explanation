CODE EXPLANATION

A.	Libraries:
1.	WiFi: Allows the ESP32 to connect to a Wi-Fi network.
2.	WiFiClient: Enables the ESP32 to create a Wi-Fi client and communicate with other devices over the network.
3.	BlynkSimpleEsp32: Provides the Blynk library for the ESP32, allowing communication with the Blynk server.
4.	LiquidCrystal_I2C: Enables control of the 20x4 LCD display using the I2C protocol.
5.	EmonLib: Library for energy monitoring, which provides functions to measure voltage and current.
6.	EEPROM: Allows storing and retrieving data in the ESP32's EEPROM memory.

B.	Blynk-related definitions and authentication:
1.	BLYNK_TEMPLATE_ID: The template ID associated with the Blynk project.
2.	BLYNK_TEMPLATE_NAME: The name of the Blynk project.
3.	BLYNK_AUTH_TOKEN: The authentication token for connecting the ESP32 to the Blynk server.

C.	Wi-Fi credentials:
1.	ssid: The name of the Wi-Fi network to connect to.
2.	pass: The password for the Wi-Fi network.

D.	LCD display initialization:
1.	A LiquidCrystal_I2C object is created with the I2C address (0x27) and the dimensions of the LCD (20x4).

E.	Energy monitoring object and calibration values:
1.	An EnergyMonitor object named "emon" is created.
2.	voltageCalibration: Calibration value for voltage measurement.
3.	currentCalibration: Calibration value for current measurement.

F.	Variables for energy tracking:
1.	kWh: Accumulated energy consumption in kilowatt-hours.
2.	totalCost: Total cost of energy consumption in Taka.
3.	lastMillis: Stores the previous millis() value for time calculations.
4.	costPerUnit: Cost per kilowatt-hour in Taka.

G.	Blynk virtual pin assignments:
1.	VRMS_VIRTUAL_PIN: Virtual pin for displaying voltage RMS.
2.	IRMS_VIRTUAL_PIN: Virtual pin for displaying current RMS.
3.	POWER_VIRTUAL_PIN: Virtual pin for displaying power.
4.	KWH_VIRTUAL_PIN: Virtual pin for displaying energy consumption in kilowatt-hours.
5.	COST_VIRTUAL_PIN: Virtual pin for displaying the total cost.

H.	Blynk timer event:
1.	The function myTimerEvent() is executed at a specified interval using the BlynkTimer object.
2.	Inside the function, the voltage, current, power, energy consumption, and total cost are calculated.
3.	The values are printed to the Serial Monitor.
4.	The values are stored in the EEPROM memory.
5.	The LCD display is updated with the new values.
6.	The values are sent to the Blynk server using the Blynk.virtualWrite() function.

I.	Setup function:
1.	The Serial communication is initiated.
2.	Blynk connection is established using the Blynk.begin() function with the provided authentication token, Wi-Fi credentials, and Blynk server.
3.	The LCD display is initialized, and the backlight is turned on.
4.	Energy monitoring is initialized with voltage and current calibration values.
5.	The Blynk timer interval is set for data logging and display updates.
6.	A startup message is displayed on the LCD.
7.	A delay of 3 seconds is added, and the LCD is cleared.

J.	Loop function:
1.	Blynk.run() and timer.run() are called to handle Blynk communication and timer events.
